*Simple web app reverse engineering*

## Introduction

At Northeastern University, many of the dorms are being modernized with these NFC door locks that allow a student to tap their NFC enabled "Husky Card" against the lock and then enter a PIN to unlock the door. The cool thing about these locks is that they are also network connected, and functions like updating your pin or even unlocking the door can be done from a little known [web interface](http://huskycardcenter.neu.edu). To be clear, "unlocking the door" from the web interface only accomplishes the equivalent of tapping your card against the lock; you'll still have to enter your PIN into the keypad on the door to get into the room. This is the definition I'll be referring to from here on out. After seeing a [vine](https://vine.co/v/hLnuEqYumpq) some friends made of a Glass app that piggybacks off the web interface to let you unlock your door via an "Ok, Glass" voice command, I thought that was really cool and wanted to see if I could do the same thing, via script.

## Analyzing the Web App

In order to unlock their door via the web interface, a user has to authenticate via their myNEU credentials, navigate to `/student/openmydoor.php` (which is not linked from the main page, and only visible when browsing with a mobile device), and click a link to open the door. Depending on where the user lives, there might be one or two links. If there are two links, the user lives in an on campus apartment, and one link unlocks the main apartment door (and requires a PIN), and the second unlocks the actual door to their bedroom and does not require a pin.

To see what was actually going on behind the scenes, I fired up [Burp Suite](http://portswigger.net/burp/) and simply walked through every step of using the web interface to see how I could write a script to emulate this behavior. Burp Suite includes a proxy, which is incredibly useful for examining requests made to websites, and even lets you break SSL connections and modify encrypted packet data. This is key, since the web interface operates using HTTPS and therefore normal packet sniffing isn't an option.

When a use navigates to huskycardcenter.neu.edu, they get redirected to the login page at `/login/ldap.php` where they are presented a form to enter their myNEU credentials. Here, I'm just using [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/) to simulate a user, using the webapp.

Here is the server response for the login page. A couple important things to notice here: the `Set-Cookie` header sets a browser cookie (duh) that looks like "defaultlang=6bge..." and there's a `<script>` tag with two Javascript variable declarations, one of which being `__sesstok`. Both of these will be necessary for submitting the login form. The form has two fields for username and password, so therefore we can then submit a POST to `/login/ldap.php`, providing the login cookie, the login form session token, username and password to log in.

After submitting this request, the browser goes through a series of redirects to bring the user to `/student/welcome.php`, however redirects aren't enabled with curl by default, and they may or may not be supported with the http requests library you're using for your script. The important thing to look for in this case is that you get a "302 Found" back from the server. This means you're authenticated and good to go. If something went wrong in the auth process, you'll get a "200 OK" and then get redirected back to the login page. The 302 response is very important because you'll notice that in this response is another `Set-Cookie` header that gives you cookie that looks similar to the login cookie we used earlier. This is the cookie we'll have to use from now on in our requests; the previous cookie won't work. 

Once you receive the "302 Found" you can test that you are indeed authenticated by submitting a simple GET to `/student/welcome.php`. In the response should be the string "Welcome to CS Gold WebCard Center...".

Now that we've successfully logged in, we need to GET `/student/openmydoor.php` where we'll find a similar situation to the login form where we need to supply a cookie, and session token to submit a POST request to `openmydoor.php` to unlock the door. We already have the cookie, and the session token will be located in a `<script>` tag in the head of the document.

In this case the session token is extremely important. It exists to protect against [Cross-site Request Forgery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Csrf) vulnerabilities, and is randomly generated each time the form page is loaded, and is also required to be in the POST request to unlock the door. If it was not present, then a hacker would be able to unlock people's doors by phishing them in some way and making them click on a malicious page that he/she controls, which will automatically send the POST request to the server to unlock the door (assuming the victim is already logged into the interface). Since the victim is logged in, the browser will supply the cookie and the request will go through. Even though this wouldn't completely unlock the door and a PIN is still required, the default PIN is just the victim's birth month and day. Since it's likely that most students don't change their PINS and birthday information is very accessible, this does not add much security.

From inspection of the web form, we can see that there is a `doorType` field which controls which door will be opened. There also is a rather curious `answeredYes` hidden field, which as far as I can tell, is just a random parameter that needs to be "yes" when the request is sent.

![](https://draftin.com:443/images/13054?token=ClmlP7bMKrH0uCrFaptQ_TcD2Ri3YsRvlfb6-KW_vvGaI3_75Dx7Yger8LOsfyqCi5559A4AdxJvmI-OiO_S_ec) 

Now that we have the cookie, session token, and know what data the POST body needs to contain, we can submit our request to unlock the door.

![](https://draftin.com:443/images/13055?token=8la4LxI7NzgsbUFsHv7emCnPfpiGTMpMOFkW-Ek3dgE03198UXDfeSN7jYt3dtENI6f3hRlLgRNcNqSdT5wMIzQ)

After this request gets sent, we got a "200 OK" from the server and in a few moments (up to 10 seconds) we should see a green light blink on the door, and then we can enter our PIN and get into the apartment. In the case where you're opening your bedroom door, the door just unlocks completely and lets you in.

Now that I know exactly what requests I have to make and what information I need to parse out of the response headers (cookie), and response body (session token), I can write a script that makes these requests and unlocks the door!

## Stumblings and Pitfalls

As you might expect, finding all this out and writing the script to do this wasn't exactly a straightforward process. One problem that took some time to figure out was where I could get the login cookie from. I didn't consider that it came with the GET request to the form page initially, and having not very much experience with how web app user auth works, I was stumped.

A bigger problem I ran into was when I was trying to write my script. Initially I was using the excellent Python [requests](http://python-requests.org) library, however it was having weird crashes with the login requests, so I decided to switch to the classic urllib2 library. This didn't crash with the login request, however it strangely didn't return the 302 I was expecting. I was stuck on this for a long time; I was able to login just fine using curl on the command line, but for some reason issuing an identical request using urllib2 always returned a 200 instead, therefore not allowing me to get the cookie needed to make future requests.

After struggling with this for far too long, I realized that it was the redirects that were causing the problem. Curl submits one request and returns one response only, so it returned the intial 302 response, but urllib2 was trying to follow the series of redirects to `/student/welcome.php`. I wasn't able to easily figure out how to stop urllib2 from following the redirects, so I decided to make yet another library switch, and use httplib instead. Httplib is a super bare bones http request library that isn't intended for actual use (it's used by other libraries, like urllib2) but it by default did not follow redirects, which was exactly what I wanted. I was then able to use httplib to complete the script. I later found out that requests easily supports not following redirects (which was the cause of the crashes earlier) and I later refactored the script to use it instead of httplib.

## Conclusion

This was a fun project to work on and I learned a lot about web applications use cookies and session tokens in the user authentication process. It was also really interesting to see CSRF protection being used in a real web application and verify that it wouldn't be possible for hackers to unlock people's doors via phishing. Thanks for reading!
